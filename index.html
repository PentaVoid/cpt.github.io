          <p>During my co-op placement, I feel like I was really able to show who I am. The work I did was challenging but fun,
            and I often would come across bugs. This allowed me to show how I am someone who doesn't give up. Even though I 
           could have just quit after every bug and asked for an easier task, I knew that wasn't who I was; I am someone who perseveres 
           through adversity. I kept working through the bugs, and solving them helped me improve as a programmer
            
           Before I started my co-op, I was very interested in computer software development, and I had taught myself how to program.
           Thanks to this co-op, I could see what being a software developer was like and improve my programming skills. I was also
           able to improve upon my patience skills, as it sometimes took a while to find a solution to my problem, and see if I was more geared toward
           this field, which, thankfully, I am.
     
           I decided to focus on business which I'm doing my SHSM in, particularly Computer Science. I have always preferred doing hands-on work, and Computer Science allows me to see
           how my code changes something in real-time, making me feel as though I am making a difference. Take this website for example,
           I love seeing my changes as I complete my CPT in real-time.

                <h5 style="text-align:left;">Through my co op I learned many new things about myself but one stands out the most, that being my ability to work alone. I often had work that I felt was out of my skill level, and I wasn’t always able to get my supervisors help. I had to learn to rely on myself to figure my problems out. </h5>

                <h5 style="text-align:left;">This experience will be very helpful to my post secondary and my workplace future, as it lets me put my programming skills to the use in a real professional environment. Not only will this improve my university application as someone with prior experience, but it helps me understand better how things will work when I actually enter the industry after post secondary.</h5>

                <h5 style="text-align:left;">During my experience with co op, when I was working on my project, I actually was required to learn new programming languages called flask and SQLite. These new skills helped me to become a well rounded developer and exposed me to different pathways. This is due to the fact that these are skills used by a backend developer, while I only possessed those of a front end developer. Now I have the skills to complete both jobs exposing me to new opportunities. I was also offered a job as a result, allowing me to connect more with the workers at STEM MINDS and increasing my network and people who can vouch for me on things such as a recommendation letter.</h5>

                <h5 style="text-align:left;">At the start of my co op I was taken around the building and shown where the fire extinguisher, the bathrooms, and different rooms were. Also on the days I worked with kids like pd days, I was also shown proper safety procedure like hand washing, etc, although due to the safety procedures we learned in class I was able to be extra precautious. this allows me to do my part in keeping STEM MINDS a safe environment for everyone and be more prepared in case anything were to happen.</h5>

              <h4 style="text-align:left;"><a style="color:#12d640">What have you learned about working for an employer and about accountability?</a><br> </h4>
              <h5 style="text-align:left;">I learned that you should always remain professional. My employers were nice and we got along well, but we always made sure things were professional and respected each other. Dating back to when we learnt about different types of management, my supervisor was definetely of the affiliative mangement type. Having a manager like this also taught me that I should always try and promote good relationships amongst workers to create a non hostile enviorment. If I ever become a manager down the line I will be sure to implement this technique into my management. I also had to learn to take accountability for my work as I would be checked in on sometimes, and if there was a mistake I made, I couldn't just shift the blame, but I took full accountability for eveything.</h5>

              <h5 style="text-align:left;">As I mentioned before, I have been offered a job on the weekends to help at STEM MINDS. This is a new opportunity for me to grow my experience in this field and continue improving up my programming skills.</h5>
            </div>

              </a><br> </h4>
              <h5 style="text-align:left;">From my time spent at my co op, three skills I developed were scheduling, problem solving, and finding information. When I was given my project in co op, I knew it might take a while to complete. To make the most use of my time, I decided to plan out what I would do, when, and how long it would take me. This allows me to be able to finish it in a reasonably good amount of time. I also had to improve my problem solving, as often I would be working alone with many bugs for long periods of time. I would have to figure out how to solve a problem without help often, so this skill was definitely improved as a result. Finally I had to improve on finding information. Not everything I was capable of doing right as I started my project. It was up to me to learn this stuff using the internet, and implement it into my project. This allowed me to gain tons of new experience in new programming languages and made me more versatile.</h5>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
      </div>
        <p>I feel as though I'm leaving my co-op more skilled, confident, and mature in my field of interest. I am glad I was able to get an oppurtunity
          like this to develop my skills in a field of choice. I have learned so much, such as new languages and frameworks like sqlite and flask, how to figure out answers yourself, and have improved my problem solving skills drastically. 
          I also improved upon my patience skills thanks to having to deal with multiple errors and have the patience and endurance to go through them all.
          I was hoping to build upon more of the frontend stuff like javascript and css, but I'm glad I got the oppurtunity to learn more about backend work. 
          This made me a more well rounded developer, continuing in helping me improve as a programmer. The most obvious pros of my co-op were me being able to implement something 
          I'd only worked on personally in a professional enviroment and gain experience in this field, for which I am thankful for. Another pro was me being able to build connections with people.
          I was able to meet other people in my career path and learn from them, and was even offered a job, which I am grateful for. The cons were that I had to work alone, but like I said, I was able to build upon 2 of the 9 transferrable skils we learned in class, thinking and continuos learning. I had to learn how to think to solve problems without the help of my supervisor, which I think was invaluable for me as this is a key skill in the world of software developement.
          My second con which was how I worked on continous learning was the fact some of the work was out of my skill range. This forced me to think outside the box and teach myself new skills to solve the problems I had.
          These cons I had helped me improve as a developer and I am thankful for both the pros and the cons. This was definetely the correct placement for me. 
          Not only was I able to get more experience and understanding in the field I want to go in, I was able to improve upon the transferable skills we learned about in class, and build more connections with people in my career, that resulted in me getting a job offer. Another thing that I feel is hardly mentioned is how co-op placmenets also improve your interview skills, When we were learning about interviews in class, I felt as though I needed more practice, but thanks to the class preperations and my actual co-op interview, I feel more experienced and prepared for not just interviews, but writing resumes and cover letters.

                <h5 style="text-align:left;">My pathway starts off with graduating highschool. From there, I get inton a university for Computer Science, preferably Waterloo. From there I take their Compuiter Science degree with co-op and graduate, hopefully getting a job at google or microsoft. </h5>
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-12 mt-4 mt-md-0 icon-box" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">

                <h5 style="text-align:left;">The three post secondary institutions that I believe will help most with my future career are U of Waterloo Computer Science with Co-op, U of Toronto Computer Science, and U of BC Computer Science. All three are top schools in Canada and can proviude me with the solid education I am looking for.</h5>
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-12 mt-4 mt-md-0 icon-box" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">
                <h4 style="text-align:left;"><a style="color:#12d640">What additional experiences will I need to pursue to be successful? Is it to further your education, more work experience, make more contacts?</a><br></h4>
                <h5 style="text-align:left;">I feel as though I need to further my education in my coding. With technology on the rise, computer science is only becoming more and more competitive. I remember during class we worked on our resume, and I was able to build a pretty impressive one. However, like I did with STEM MINDS, I want to continue updating my resume with new things. Especially whenm we worked on the skills and experience section, as I feel these are two of the most important parts of a resume that often can be underwhelming.</h5>

                <h4 style="text-align:left;"><a style="color:#12d640">What challenges might I face and how can I overcome them? </a><br> </h4>
                <h5 style="text-align:left;">I remember this one challenge I had to face not in my co-op, but in another job of mine. we were really busy serving people and food fell on the floor. One of my co-workers wanted to serve it but I said no, as that would be unsanitary and potentially cause sickness to the customer. This makes me think about when we learnt about ethics, and what's right and wrong in a workplace, I did the wright thing because I followed my ethics, knowing I could have gotten away with not doing so. I was tempted but I made trhe correct choice in the end, so this is something I want to be able to overcome in the future if anything similar happens. I want to continously use my ethics to make educated decisions.</h5>

                <h4 style="text-align:left;"><a style="color:#12d640">What is your preferred career?</a><br> </h4>
                <h5 style="text-align:left;">My preferred career is as a software developer at a FAANG company. More specifically a front-end web developer.</h5>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-12 mt-4 mt-md-0 icon-box" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">
              <h4 style="text-align:left;"><a style="color:#12d640">Describe the education or training that is required to attain your preferred career?</a><br> </h4>
              <h5 style="text-align:left;">While many computer programmers can be self taught, it is typically required to complete a degree in Computer Science. After that you can enter as a junior level developer. However, as a senior software developer it typically requires tons of years of experience in the field, and many of them even go and get their masters in CS.</h5>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-12 mt-4 mt-md-0 icon-box" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">
              <h4 style="text-align:left;"><a style="color:#12d640">List 3 educational/ training facilities (colleges, universities, private institutions, apprenticeships, workplace) that offer programs to help you pursue your preferred career. </a><br> </h4>
              <h5 style="text-align:left;">The three universities that offer programs for my pursued career are as stated above, U of Waterloo Computer Science with Co-op, U of Toronto Computer Science, and U of BC Computer Science.</h5>

              <h5 style="text-align:left;">Computer Science requires university level education to typically even be considered for a job. If we look at University of Waterloo Computer Science, with the co-op program it takes 5 years, without it takes 4. The course costs around $9,000 for each year of tuition. As this is a top university, the price is of course higher, so one can look at the average per year to be around $6000.</h5>
